_This is a mirror of my C++ solutions for about half of the_ [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) _problems_

You can find the code along with in-depth explanations and live demos at https://euler.stephan-brumme.com

Below is an excerpt from https://euler.stephan-brumme.com/why/ :


# Why do I publish my solutions ?

Almost always the solutions for problems at Project Euler consist of two parts:
1. finding a mathematical way to break down the problem's structure into its elements
2. writing an efficient program for step 1

I strive to:
* explain my choice of algorithms and data structures
* write fully commented C++ source code that compiles without warnings and _without any external libraries_
* interactive tests for most problems
* link to relevant [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) / [MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com) / [OEIS](https://oeis.org) pages
* link to other solutions, especially those that are written in other programming languages

Let's not forget that it helps me, too: only if I can explain a solution to someone else then I can be sure _that I truly understood it in the first place_.
And practicing some of the lesser used features of C++ (such as algorithms hidden inside STL, like **std::next_permutation**) improves my overall coding skills as well.

Sounds like a win-win situation ...


# "But You Shouldn't Publish Your Solutions !"

Project Euler encourages you **NOT** to publish solutions.

I have a different point of view:
* 99% of my knowledge is based on things I was taught, I saw somewhere or I stumbled across
* and maybe 1% is "original"
* I'm pretty sure it's not just me - it's the way how all of us gain knowledge

So it boils down to:
* having a good teacher
* access to well-equipped library
* and probably most important today: your skills in working with a search engine

If someone visits my website/repository then he/she already realized that he/she can't solve that problem and is doing the right thing: ask someone.
That's the only way how knowledge can be spread - all famous scientists wrote books.
[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) was one of the most productive mathematicians and he published 866 papers/books/etc. He shared his knowledge.
And a substantial number of my solutions is based on some of his formulas, I only solved them because I could look up his works.

Admittedly, there is no use in publishing lists of the results to Project Euler problems. In my opinion, these numbers don't matter at all:
noone really cares whether the result of [problem 1](https://euler.stephan-brumme.com/1/) is 233167, 233168 or 233169.
That's why you find algorithms, explanations, links, code, ..., basically everything on my website - but not the results.
Because these numbers don't teach you anything.
